IN HTML EACH PAGE SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE "h1"(and you can have sub topics)

   
        <link rel="icon " type ="image/x-icon  " href="download.png">

    			Example:- <em></em> and <strong ></strong > tags 


HTML Entities :-
                There are some special character that we can not put easily in html like greater and less than symbols in our html so we use html entities in our code. They always starts with ampercent (&) 
                Example :- 
                       Some of the html entities that we can use in our script are 
                       1. &nbsp; for space 
                       2. &lt; for less than symbol
                       3. &gt; for greater than symbol
                       4 &copy; for copy right symbol
                       5.<abbr> titile=" full form of abbrivation ">HEC</abbr>
